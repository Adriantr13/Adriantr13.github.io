### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite lab to do because it introduced the basics of coding. I liked the part where we had to learn how to add a repository. I really liked how we were taught how to push all the changes to Github.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was my favorite because it was the first lab where we had 2 parts and it was very exciting to try and do both. My partner was very helpful in understanding different topics where I needed help with. Although we did not finish all of it, we tried our best and had fun trying to make it work.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was my favorite because it involved blackjack and Blackjack is very cool to play. It was very fun to figure out the code and make it work.
